        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Anika Kisling and I am currently a freshman in the pre-business program at the University of California, Riverside. In another year’s time, I plan to apply to their school of business, where I will declare my concentration in management with a focus in human resources. Though I am not a member of any clubs on campus, I hope to become more involved with time, as I am eager to make my mark and gain a wide array of skills that will be useful to me and employment in the future.<br><br>

        At this point in time I hold no prior formal job experience and am currently unemployed. Despite my lack of experience in the job market, I have much experience in past leadership areas as well as volunteer work. My past experiences include attending the Rotary Youth Leadership Awards Conference, which allowed me to have an opportunity to better my leadership skills through a series of mock interviews as well as lectures, and further improve the way I work with a team in accomplishing an overarching goal. In terms of management, founding and becoming president of my high school’s Marine Life Appreciation Club taught me what it truly takes to be able to host an event and ensure all runs smoothly, conduct meetings with lesson plans that convey the club’s message, as well as oversee the cabinet and club progress overall. The position that taught me the most about teamwork skills was my time as Drum Major with my high school’s marching band. At this time, I learned how to come together and address the differing needs of a large group of people, run rehearsals, and ensure progress was being made. In terms of volunteering experience, working at my local church carnival each year has allowed me to run booths as well as network/engage with customers. This has opened me up to being more gregarious, as well as given me a chance to network, which are both crucial to a management position. Volunteer experiences with my schools band have given me opportunities to travel and interact with various groups and clientele, furthering my ability to adapt in new situations and environments. All aspects of the skill sets that I have learned from my time in these positions can be readily applied to the work environment, specifically a concentration such as management or human resources as both heavily rely on the relations between people in order to ensure that the work environment is one of positivity and advancement. <br><br>

        Aside from people skills, my personal skills have also prepared me for tackling employment in the business field. These include my will to persevere, being technologically savvy in various computer programs and platforms, as well as being able to fluently read, write, and speak Spanish. These, combined with what I have learned in past years, have allowed me to have a renewed sense of confidence in my career choices, and will allow me to be successful in my desired career field.
